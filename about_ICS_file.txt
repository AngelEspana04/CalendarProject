The ICS file is a file that allows users to share calendar information on the web and over email, meaning that 
when users send a meeting request to others, they can share ICS files with them, who can import the meeting's details into their calendars.

When you export calendar data to an ICS file, typically you'll see options to select the time range of events to export 
and the option to choose which calendars or events to include in the exported file if you have multiple calendars. 

Once the export process is complete, you'll usually be prompted to download the generated ICS file, which you can then save to your computer or device
and be imported into other calendar applications or shared with others who can import it into their own calendar systems, allowing them to view your events.

CREATE A .ICS FILE:

In order to create an .ics file, also called iCalendar file, we have to open a text editor.

Next step is to declare the iCalendar version and providing a unique identifier for the calendar. For example:

      BEGIN:VCALENDAR -> 'Encloses the entire calendar data.'
      VERSION:2.0 -> 'Specifies the iCalendar version.'
      PRODID: -> 'Identifies the product that created the iCalendar file.'

Secondly, add the event data:

      BEGIN:VEVENT -> 'Encloses individual event data.'
      UID: -> 'Unique identifier for the event.'
      DTSTAMP: -> 'Timestamp when the event was created'
      DTSTART: -> 'Start date/time of the event.' 
      DTEND: -> 'End date/time of the event.'
      SUMMARY: -> 'Title of the event' 
      LOCATION: -> 'Location of the event.'
      DESCRIPTION: -> 'Description or additional information about the event'
      END:VEVENT -> 'Close the iCalendar file'

Finally, save the file with a .ics extension, which can now be shared or imported into various calendar applications. 
Then, users can import the iCal file into their calendar applications to add the events to their calendars.
